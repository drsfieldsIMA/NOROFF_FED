It was the first J mission, with a longer stay on the Moon and a greater focus on science than earlier landings. Apollo 15 had the first use of the Lunar Roving Vehicle.

          <h3>The International Space station is Built</h3>
          <p> The space station is designed to be a permanent orbiting research facility. 
            Its major purpose is to perform world-class science and research that only a microgravity environment can provide. 
            The station crew spends their day working on science experiments that require their input, as well as monitoring those that are controlled from the ground. They also take part in medical experiments to determine how well their bodies are adjusting to living in microgravity for long periods of time.
            Working on the space station also means ensuring the maintenance and health of the orbiting platform.

        <h3>Spacewalk to repair the Station's power supply</h3>
        <p>Astronauts perform many tasks as they orbit Earth. Crew members are constantly checking support systems and cleaning filters, updating computer equipment: doing many of the things homeowners must do to ensure their largest investment stays in good shape. Similarly, the Mission Control Center constantly monitors the space station and sends messages each day through voice or email with new instructions or plans to assist the crew members in their daily routines.</p>

      <h3>BioRock making chemically elements out of regolith</h3>
      <p>A new investigation on the International Space Station represents the first study of how microbes grow on and alter planetary rocks in microgravity and simulated Martian gravity. The study, BioRock, also is the first test of extraterrestrial biomining and the first use of a prototype miniature mining reactor in space.
              
        “We’re studying three types of microbes, giving us the first comparison between behaviors of different microbes in the space environment,” said principal investigator Charles Cockell, professor at the UK Centre for Astrobiology, University of Edinburgh. Scientists know very little about how microgravity affects microbe and mineral interactions, but previous research demonstrates that the attachment of microbes to surfaces, or formation of biofilms, occurs differently in space.
        
        In general, biofilms increase, grow thicker and show particular shapes and structures in microgravity. Investigators expect to see similar behavior by the microbes in the BioRock investigation.
